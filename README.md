## Description
<p>
  Out of the box sollution for managing movement of camera in your game and interaction with different gameObjects using the collider. 
</p>

### Features
 *  Panning with one finger in any direction with the finger remaining always under the touched object [also know as pixel perfect panning]

 * Panning has inertia

 * WorldSpace limits and orthographic limits

 * Gizmo drawing in UNITY EDITOR to know the limits of the camera

 * Visual feedback for achieving minimum ortho
    
 * Pinching with two or more fingers with zooming target in the middle point of the two fingers

 * Supports panning during the pinching operation

 * Ignores any UI elements during touch operation

 * Detects tap on GameObjects for opening screens or panels [UI canvas]
<br>

## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity.com/) in <img src=https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C%23-blue height = 14px/>

# Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sergane13/Camera-Movement-By-Touch
   ```
   
2. Open project in Unity
    ```sh
    Tested Unity version: 2021.2.0f1
    ```

3. Add scripts to any gameObject you want and assign the main camera to it
    <p>
      <img src="images/2.png" alt="Logo" width="700">
    </p>
 

### How to use it

  * The first script is `PanPinchCameracMovement.cs` that is used for managing the inputs from the user [touch inputs].
    * `cameraToMove`
        * The camera component that will be manipulated by the user
    * `limitXmin`
        * The minimum position of the camera field of view on X axis
    * `limitXmax`
        * The maximum position of the camera field of view on X axis 
    * `limitYmin`
        * The minimum position of the camera field of view on Y axis
    * `limitYmax`
        * The maximum position of the camera field of view on Y axis
    * `orthoMin`
        * The minum orhographic size of the camera
    * `orthoMax`
        * The maximum orhographic size of the camera
    * `interpolationStep` 
        * Sensitivity value for calculating the camera drag (inertia) after release of the finger.
        Reccomended value: 0.2
  * The second script is `TapOnGameObject.cs` that is responsible vor validating the "tap" on a gameobject veryfiyng that the finger has not left the initial touch position, taking in consideration a small sensitivity to get rid of false positives.
    * `sensitivity`
        * value for filtering touch.deltaposition to consider the touch as MOVING
        * Reccomended value: 0.2

### Disclaimer 

  * Both scripts are using the **old input system** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
  * Using the new input system will results in a lot of errors and incompatibilities, especialy with managing touch on UI elements
  * Using **Device Simulator** will create unwanted behaviour due to unknown reasons. Test the scripts by building an apk file and intalling it on your device.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

# Usage

#### After reasearching for quite a while, we could not find a good and sustainable sollution for camera movement for mobile aplications. In our case it was needed to build a 2d city builder game where user has to interact with the environment. It can be easily used in any 2d isometric games similar with `HayDay` or `Clash of Clans`. We tried to mimic the bahaviour that it is found in supercell games for camera movement, but adaptated for our usage.

* You can test the usage of the scripts in our game [Khyron Realm](https://khyron-realm.com/)
* You can also see the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhusqjg41g8&t=78s&ab_channel=KhyronRealm) video
